🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js (v18 or higher)
MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)
Clerk account for authentication

Create a new project using this boilerplate
git clone https://github.com/AnwarHossainSR/nextjs-15-template.git
cd nextjs-15-template

Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_clerk_webhook_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string


Get NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY from the Clerk Dashboard under API Keys.
Set up a webhook in Clerk and use the signing secret as CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
Use a MongoDB connection string (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database for local or a MongoDB Atlas URI).

Configure Clerk
In the Clerk Dashboard:

Go to Settings > Paths and configure:
Sign-in path: /sign-in
Sign-up path: /sign-up
After sign-in: /dashboard
After sign-up: /dashboard


Enable desired authentication methods (e.g., email, Google OAuth).

Install Dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

Start Development Server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

Your application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

🔐 Authentication
This boilerplate uses Clerk for authentication, providing a secure and scalable solution for user management. Key routes include:

/sign-in: Clerk's sign-in page, redirects to /dashboard after successful login.
/sign-up: Clerk's sign-up page, redirects to /dashboard after account creation.
/dashboard: Protected route, accessible only to authenticated users, featuring a sidebar with profile and settings navigation.
/api/webhooks: Public route for handling Clerk webhook events (e.g., user creation).

The middleware (middleware.ts) ensures that routes like /dashboard are protected, while /, /sign-in, /sign-up, and /api/webhooks are publicly accessible.
🗄️ Database
MongoDB is integrated for persistent data storage. The MONGODB_URI in the .env file connects to your MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based). Example usage includes storing user-related data synced via Clerk webhooks.
💅 Styling
This boilerplate uses Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom theme configuration that supports light and dark modes. Styled Components are generated at build time and served with the document generated by Next.js Server Side Rendering for optimal performance.
The project includes Google Fonts (Inter and Poppins) preloaded at build time for improved performance and consistent typography.
🧩 Development Features
Absolute Imports
Absolute imports are configured with the @/ prefix starting from the src folder:
// Instead of this
import { Button } from '../../../components/ui/Button';

// You can write this
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';

Import Sorting
Imports are automatically grouped and sorted in the following order:

External dependencies
Absolute imports (@/*)
Relative imports

This is implemented using eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort.
Code Quality
ESLint extends:

eslint-config-airbnb
eslint-config-next
eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y for accessibility recommendations

Git Hooks
On every commit, staged files are validated with ESLint using Husky and lint-staged:
"husky": {
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
  }
},
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": "eslint --cache --fix --cache-location ./node_modules/.cache/.eslintcache"
}

🔍 SEO

Comprehensive meta tags in the layout file
OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata
/public/robots.txt configured to allow indexing
Sitemap generation support
